        <h4>About ask_Mong&uuml;ss</h4>
        <p>
            ask_Mong&uuml;ss(pronounced mongoose) is an educational tool designed by students and instructors, for students and instructors,
            to help facilitate discussion and learning outside the normal classroom environment. This application is
            one more tool in the educator's toolbox to provide a quality education that will last a student's lifetime.
            <br><br>
            ask_Mong&uuml;ss allows students to ask their instructors questions about their course's syllabus, assignments,
            and exams, and provides a Frequently Asked Questions page that instructors can customize to the needs of their
            students. This not only centralizes questions regarding course content into a single source, but also frees
            up the instructors e-mails so that they can better organize their tasks.
