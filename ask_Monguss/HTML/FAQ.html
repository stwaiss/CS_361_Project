		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

		<p>For the most part, if you have a question, your peers have that same question too. The table below shows questions that your instructor frequently recieves, and wants to share with you and your peers. Please take a look through the table before submitting any questions, as your question may have already been answered!
